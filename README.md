**`(Developer/Tutor/Student)`**

I am a backend developer, but I can also do frontend if the situation calls for. I take time building applications and understanding how each program works from the start to after it executes all functions. All of my projects here were built from the ground up from my time in school. 




I'm an indie full-stack developer and content creator building my version of the digital world one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. All video content is built the same way, from ideation and planning, all the way to finalizing the content with artistic touches. I publish that content on my YouTube channel "[ForrestKnight][youtube]" to more than 500k subscribers.
